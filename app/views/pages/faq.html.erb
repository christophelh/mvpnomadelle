                <p>In 2017 one of our co-founders had a really tough experience while trying to get OBGYN care in Berlin. She was not in the German system and her situation (early risk pregnancy) was not considered an emergency by the hospitals or travel insurance companies. It took her 2 weeks to find a private walk in service who would take her and finally have a scan.

                From that moment she  started talking with other women who mentioned similar problems while trying to get women's health or family planning care options while on the road.

                Nomadelle was born to give women access to walk in ob/gyn, fertility and family planning services all over the world. Our society is global, our women's health services are too.

                <p>Nomadelle is creating a global database of OBGYN, fertility and family planning services. At this moment you can access to our emergency pill and regular contraceptives database and understand where can you buy them. We are developing our walk in practices guide so you can in a very near future book appointment online directly with Nomadelle and access to travel insurances designed focusing in  women needs.</p>
